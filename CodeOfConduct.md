# Ladies of Code Glasgow: Code of Conduct

Ladies of Code events are community events intended for collaboration in the tech community. We value the participation of each member and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout all Ladies of Code events.

To make clear what is expected, all attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organisers, and volunteers at any Ladies of Code event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organisers will enforce these codes throughout the event.



## Code of Conduct

Ladies of Code is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, nationality or level of experience. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form nor do we tolerate any behaviour that would reasonably lead to another event participant being made to feel unsafe, insecure, or frightened for their physical or emotional well-being. All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the organisers.


Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.


Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the event organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event and community.


If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the Ladies of Code Team immediately. 


Our team will be happy to help participants contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your participation and attendance.
