## What is HacktoberFest?

> HacktoberFest is an annual month-long celebration of open source software encouraging meaningful contributions to any open source project. Its run by DigitialOcean in partnership with GitHub and Dev and anyone can participate whether you are a first time contributor or a veteran!

### But what is open source software (OSS)?
**Simply put...**
>“Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.
Its authors make its source code available to others who would like to view that code, copy it, learn from it, alter it, or share it.”

The principles of open source that OS projects should strive for:
- **Transparency**
-- Transparency not only of the code itself, but the decision making and processes involved in the project
- **Collaboration**
-- Collaboration on a platform with other fellow contributors all working towards common goals which is often reflected by the OSS project's vision
- **Participation & Community**
-- Make anything a Contribution! Encouraging participation in many forms whether you're a developer, writer, or end user will help grow a healthy and vibrant community

### Ok, but what impact does this have?

**Huge Impact!**  Every contribution helps! We can not stress enough that your PR, which could contain a bug fix; typo correction; new feature; or even broken link fix is appreciated by the hard working maintainers of the projects. These maintainers are often working silly hours volunteering because they believe in their project. So seeing PRs that are well formed, descriptive and open for collaboration the maintainers acknowledge that:
- You use or enjoy the software/project
- You are willing to help out (what a huge boost!)
- You code will impact others using the project for the better!

 In most things, including Open Source Software, you get out what you put in and often skimming the surface of OS you're not going to find its true benefits. But if we can give back to our favourite projects by our contribution then we can have a positive impact on others using the software as well as driving it.

### Sounds exciting! How can I join the celebration? 🎉

- Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!
- Pull requests can be made in any public GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.
- Sign up anytime between [October 1 and October 31](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).

## How do I get started? 💻 

### How to setup Git :octocat:

If you have already used git before then you can skip this step. Else here are some fantastic tutorials on how to install git, clone a repo and make your first GitHub pull request.

**Forking, Cloning a GitHub Repo & creating a PR**

Ok, so we have taking the first steps on creating a test PR. Well Done! 👏 👏 👏
You can check out your PR progress on your [HacktoberFest profile](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/profile)!

Now let's see what other projects we can contribute to!

### What Projects could I contribute to?

For the purposes of HacktoberFest the target is to contribute 4 'valid' Pull Requests to any public open source project hosted on GitHub. However there are a few things you should consider before picking a OS project to invest your time & effort into.

- Does it enforce a good Code of Conduct? You can usually find the CoC referenced on the project's README like [LadiesofCodeGlasgow](https://github.com/ladiesofcode/glasgow/blob/master/CodeOfConduct.md) 
- Is the project active i.e. does it have alot of contributors, stars or forks?
-- The more active usually means PRs will be regularly reviewed and feedback provided
- Is the community welcoming? 
-- Are there clear instructions on how to contribute? What is the review process and suggested form of collaboration (RFCs, or screenshots)

To note, if projects don't have these, perhaps suggest improvements either as a PR or issue if you feel it will be a benefit to the project. ❤️

### What Projects do I want to contribute to?

**That's a good question!** 

Perhaps start off with asking yourself these questions:
- **What languages do you feel comfortable with? PHP, Javascript?**
-- This doesn't necessarily need to be code base. Documentation often needs to be written or translated so you could say English or if bi-lingual additional languages e.g Spanish
- **What skill set do you want to aim for?** first-timer issues, or complete features or a combination of both?
- **What are my interests?** AI, Machine learning, Project Management, Silly fun, and/or  humanitarian projects?
- **Do you love a particular OSS that you use frequently?**
- **How does my contribution impact others or myself?**
-- If more then yourself you could encourage others to help with the solution

There are many ways to search GitHub based on these answers and usually break them down into langauges. Here are only a few suggestions.

#### First Timer

- [Awesome for Beginners](https://github.com/mungell/awesome-for-beginners)
-- Breaks some down into languages
- [GitHub Search for 'First-Timer-Only'](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Afirst-timers-only+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen&type=)

#### Fun & Silly

- [EmojiScreen is a listing of movies, TV shows and musicals depicted through emojis.](https://emojiscreen.com/)
- [Find the emoji that echoes your mind](https://github.com/muan/emoji)
- [Repo full of fun repos](https://github.com/mislavcimpersak/awesome-dev-fun)
- [Commit Message Generator](https://github.com/ngerakines/commitment)

If you see any more why don't you add to this list? 😉

### Ok, Let's do this!

Right, you have an idea on what projects you want to try and contribute to lets prepare and plan how to achieve them.

**Set your goals**

For the sake of HacktoberFest the goal to get a limited edition t-shirt is to create **4** valid PRs within the month of October. However you can set whatever personal best you want!

- Luckily there are 5 weeks in October, perhaps aim for 1 PR a week!
- Make your own goals, and be proud of what you achieve! 
- Post about it – You can post about the achieve itself (first pull request!) and/or reaching the 4 Prs! We would ❤️ to hear about it!
- Enjoy yourself, every PR is welcomed!

**Follow CONTRIBUTION guides**

Not only should you follow each OS project CONTRIBUTION guide (they may be different processes) but also keep these points in mind after you create PRs

- Ensure you filled out as much info in the PR as possible
-- This allows reviewers to quickly assess that you as a contributor are eager to collaborate (not just a drive by)
- More information reduces the chances of PR being incorrectly marked as invalid
-- Project Maintainers are going to be swamped so they need to assess quickly of the PR’s nature and value it brings to the project
- Be patience
-- Ultimate end goal is to get PRs merged, but for the sake of HacktobferFest you only need to create 4 Prs. So don’t worry if Prs take a while to get a response from the maintainers. Just remember to be responsive (if you can) when they do respond.

**Encounter any negativity**

With the huge increase of OS activity this month there may be cases where unsolicited advice comes in. Usual advice is to ignore it unless they are of a position that would affect the PR itself i.e. member from the project’s team/maintainers. If possible report it – use the Code of Conduct. If borderline, still report it. As first time contributors the project wants to know from you how they could encourage more and if negativity is a factor they should be made aware of that.

But we are all here to help so if you feel affected then feel free to reach out to us members within the Ladies of Code Glasgow!
