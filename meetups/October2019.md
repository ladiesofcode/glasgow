# October meetup - Lightning Talks and Lean Coffee
 
 For the October Meetup we have some fantastic talks AND we will be running a lean coffee :smiley::purple_heart:

## Lightening Talks :sparkles:

A lightning talk is a very short presentation, during which the speakers will tell us about a range of topics. Currently on the agenda are Progressive Web Apps and and form development. 
Would you like to give a talk? There will be slots available on the night too.

We are a friendly meetup for new speakers and talks! No matter how unpolished the presentations are, we are here to support you in your speaking journey.

## Lean Coffee :coffee:

If time allows, we will also run a lean coffee on the night. Apolagies in advance, as there are no coffees, of the drinking type, involved.

A lean coffee is a great opportunity to surface your questions, generate discussions and share experiences. 
The format of the lean coffee is described [here](http://leancoffee.org/)

See you then!
