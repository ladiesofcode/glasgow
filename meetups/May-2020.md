# Resources on Static Blogs

## GitHub pages & Travis CI

### Ingredients:
* Hugo
* Hugo theme (https://themes.gohugo.io/)
* GitHub repo (x2)
* Travis-CI account

### Steps:

1. Start by building a simple Hugo blog
2. Choose a nice theme
> I personally use https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-casper because it has alot of good features out the box
3. Add original theme as a submodule (optional)
> This allows you to separate the original theme to continue receiving updates without merge conflicts. Copy the theme folder and rename it appropriately. Add the new theme name within config.toml

> https://github.com/samus-aran/blog-resources/blob/master/.gitmodules

4. Preview your new blog on localhost:1313
> Awesome right?!
5. Push your new blog onto a GitHub repo 
> I created a "blog-resources" repo. You can see my steps (and mistakes) via the commit history. 

> https://github.com/samus-aran/blog-resources

> https://github.com/samus-aran/blog-resources/commits/master

> Note: this repo does not include public as that would be moved to your new repo in the later steps so don't worry if you committed it at this stage.
6. Create another GitHub repo specific to GitHub pages (username)
> https://github.com/samus-aran/samus-aran.github.io

> https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages
7. Add the new repo as a submodule to your original repo (resources)
> See link to my repo .gitmodules

8. Manually push /public to your GitHub pages repo - It's live!
>
9. Automate using Travis-CI using .travis.yml
> Travis-CI actually has a page on how to use it to deploy to GitHub Pages

> https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pages/

>Travis CI is a sandbox which runs the commands you want (great for testing and auto deploying) and in our case we want to ‘build’ hugo with the correct theme, deploy to a remote repo using our GitHub token.

10. Set up Travis account and supply GitHub Access Token (safely)

> Once you've ccreated your Access Token you can set the variable 
> $GITHUB_TOKEN within Travis-CI's environment variable settings.

> https://github.com/samus-aran/blog-resources/blob/master/.travis.yml

> https://github.com/samus-aran/blog-resources/commit/154667675d9bb35d96bcf101db42cb9e3d2f3d79

> Note: DO NOT add this token within your git repo itself

11. Push to your resources repo and watch it deply to your GitHub Pages!

> You can see Travis-CI deploying within the commit itlsef with a green tick or red cross. On Travis-CI.org you can live track ow the deploying is running and if need to debug can view it's logs.
